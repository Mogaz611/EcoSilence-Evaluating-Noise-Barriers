# EcoSilence-Evaluating-Noise-Barriers
A project focused on assessing the effectiveness of noise barriers using Arduino sensors and Python. Real-time noise data is collected, processed, and analyzed, with statistical tests applied to evaluate barrier performance. The goal is to enhance understanding of noise pollution control strategies.
